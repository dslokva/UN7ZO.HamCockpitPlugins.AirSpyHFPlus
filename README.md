# HamCockpit AirSpyHFPlus Adapter plugin

First pre-release.

You should copy all files from "lib" directory to folder where HamCockpit executable and dll files stored.

This plugin has **experimental** support of OmniRig and can be used with any transceiver. This is switchable option.
OmniRig support code will be removed after new release of  HamCockpit.
